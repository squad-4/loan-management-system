> A simple API to manage the loan payments control system from a fintech

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to create an API to manage the loan payments control system from a fintech.

## Problem

A fintech needs to keep track of the amount of money loaned and the missed/made payments. It also needs a place to retrieve the volume of outstanding debt at some point in time.

## Purpose

The purpose of this challenge is to test your ability to implement a solution given an abstract problem. You may find a problem in the asked task that you need to explain the problem and propose a solution to fix it.
The challenge was proposed by [Codenation](https://codenation.dev), as part of the **Acelera Dev - Python para Web** program.
